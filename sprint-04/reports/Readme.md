### UI/UX Report
The UI for the site hasn’t had much progress, we’ve had a lot of difficulties trying to fix and implement most of the features that were discussed by the group to be activated in the site.


### Infrastructure Report
During Sprint 4, I was able to figure out shh errors occured on making deploy keys last week and make both frontend and backend work on my end with out project manager's help. At this point both VMs are working on my end and able to connect everything we need.


### Developer Report
During sprint 4 I had issues accessing my builds. However I was able to create admin user accounts with full privileges. Going forward, we plan on testing this with the user authentication and user creation scripts to be able to successfully log into the site.

### Security Report
Created a non-root/admin user for the database activities. Automated the creation of firewall rules and properly enabled any services to start on boot already done in Sprint 3.
Included the creation of at least 3 user accounts, which was done also in Sprint 3.
SSH key deployd, named: Lucas’s key.
