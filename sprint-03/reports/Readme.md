UI/UX Artifacts

IT Infrastructure
* This week, we were able to build Sprint 02â€™s program completely and view the website from the IP address provided by our web server. For Sprint-03, we were able to successfully split our monolithic application from Sprint-02 into two servers for the front end and back end. Both the front end and back end are fully functional and ready for deployment. All the scripts are stored in the code folder and any instructions to deploy are in the install.md file.
