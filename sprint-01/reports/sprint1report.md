## UI/UX Report

When we started our project: Item Swapping Site, we considered multiple web-based graphics editors and prototyping tools. We chose Figma as our top choice platform. It not only supports desktop, but also supports apps for Android and IOS allowing viewing Figma prototypes on different mobile devices.
We would like our UI/UX to be perfect which means the theme, texts and icons have to be matched with each other. We choose this kind of dark color theme. My goal is to deliver a clean, minimal and functional website in the end so there is still a lot to be improved and get done in the future.


## Developer Report

Front-End
Angular JS
Used in the front-end of Netflix, Paypal, Gmail.
Allows for quick development and presentation using two way binding which allows for the view and model to be synchronized if any changes were to occur.
Creates templates using HTML which is widely used for front end.
Real time testing.

NodeJS - Javascript/ Back end
Used in a long time marketplace app, ebay.
We are primarily focusing on developing a web application.
Scaleable for when we start testing with.
Able to run cross-platform whether it's Linux, Mac or Windows.
Allows for the use of JSON, which makes it easier to store and read data.
Front page design is mainly populated by user entries of sales, so it doesn’t have to be complex.


## IT Infrastructure Report

Operating system and platform:
Taking into consideration the immediate expertise of the group, as well as the time constraints, we decided to make our project web based (run on browsers).
This makes our project bothe easy to execute, manage and affords it to be platform independent.
We intend to use HTML, CSS and javascript to build the site which will be hosted on our team git repository

Database:
We intend to create our database using MySQL (tentative) which will also be hosted on our git repository
Our SQL schema should look like the image attached below:


## Developer and Security Assumptions

Requires the authentication/verification of college emails IF access is strictly for college students
Authentication of proper user accounts by verifying username and password.
Passwords will have to be encrypted
Protection of user post location applied for people browsing
User to user encryption of messages to protect privacy and location information typed in chats


## User/Admin/Anonymous Story Goes here

The User story
A user who is looking to purchase an item can enter the home page and sign up or log in to their account. Users looking to sign up will be asked to enter their college email address if they are looking to purchase. Once they find an item they would like to purchase, they can click the “Request purchase”(rename it) button.
Users looking to sell items will be directed to a slightly different page where the user can make an account and is only able to post items to sell. A badge showing that they are unverified will show on their account and the layout to create the post will be shown.


The Admin Story
	Admins once logged in should have extra buttons that allow the admin to take down posts or hide posts, ban users and take down their posts, or bring posts to the front page.
Keeps track of "karma" as people rate the seller and the transactions, like a rating system, which -as admin- will include banning users that sell stolen items or users that are taking advantage of others (scamming).


Unauthenticated Users
This application is designed for the use of college students, so only verified college students should be the only ones allowed to purchase items on the site.


## Project Manager Report

To start organizing, we created a server on Slack, which is one of the best applications to communicate with group members and the professor in real time. With also good features including creating specialised channels to talk about certain topics, and direct messaging members.
The project management application that was chosen -to keep everyone on the same page and have a schedule on what is due, and what will be done- was Trello. Very simple and direct application that will surely help us all the way through our project.
A Google Share Drive was also created, to insert documents, slides, and excels, where we can all work together and see what each member did, everything live in the cloud. Therefore nobody will be needing to create documents on their own, then sending it through Slack or email and wasting time.
In the pictures below you will find what how our project is been managed:
